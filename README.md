# FastAStar

This repository is an attempt to speed up the A* pathfinding algorithm using approaches like multithreading and alternative backing data structures.

## Why

This project is done as the assignment for the university course "Advanced Tools" at CMGT at Saxion UAS in Enschede.

## Evaluation Proposal

> In the context of Artificial Intelligence, I want to explore different approachs of speeding up the A* algorithm using multithreading, like PNBA* (https://homepages.dcc.ufmg.br/~chaimo/public/ENIA11.pdf) or Parallel Bidirectional A* (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/395556), and (if feasible) different underlying data structures like different types of heaps, e.g. Concurrent Priority Queue Heaps (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0020019096001482) or Soft Heaps (https://epubs.siam.org/doi/pdf/10.1137/1.9781611973068.53), by comparing speed, memory usage, etc. to the "default" variant.
